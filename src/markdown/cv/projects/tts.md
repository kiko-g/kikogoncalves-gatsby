- Designed and developed a platform for **University of Porto students to build the schedule options for the classes in their next semester**.
- Responsible for the first release of the project on August 2022.
- The platform is in continuous development and there are plans of improving the experience and expanding the scope of the project (i.e., allow students to fully rely on the platform to switch already assigned classes with others, depending on preferences)
