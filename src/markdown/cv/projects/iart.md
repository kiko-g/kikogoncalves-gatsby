- Created a tool that uses Supervised Learning models to harness a Kaggle dataset of around 25k football matches in order to predict the outcome of other
  matchups according to a set of classes (win, draw, loss, etc.)
- Compared Machine Learning algorithms, such as Kâ€‘Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Neural
