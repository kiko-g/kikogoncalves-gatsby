I'm a Software Engineering student from Porto, Portugal, currently enrolled in the first year of my Masters's Degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering @ FEUP. I have a great passion for software engineering as a whole with a special interest in frontend development and data science. On the more personal side of things, I would describe myself as a passionate person, who believes in getting better every day and finding zeal in things. My interests are mostly music, gaming, football, media, and entertainment. As for hobbies, I often play the guitar, sing, game, program, and exercise.
