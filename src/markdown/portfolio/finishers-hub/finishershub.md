- Built a dynamic museum of fun COD videoclips with just finishing moves.
- For v1 videos were pulled from the **Twitch API**.
- For v2 videos are stored in S3 Buckets and pulled from the **AWS API**.
- Implemented a [registry](https://finishershub.vercel.app/registry) feature for the team to be able to **track and manage stats**.
- Developed a [lab system](https://finishershub.vercel.app/lab) to keep track of stats and characteristics of finishing moves.
