- Built a dynamic museum of fun COD videoclips using Gatsby.
- Videos are pulled and processed from the **Twitch API**.
- Implemented a registry feature for the team to be able to **track and manage stats**.
- There are plans for **future releases**, migrating from the Twitch API and using a large storage system (e.g. S3) and manage the content from an admin page. This way the clips could be curated and from other sources.
