description: A videoclip musuem of finishing moves.
---

- Built a dynamic museum of fun COD videoclips using Gatsby
- Videos are pulled and processed from the Twitch API
- There are plans for future releases, migrating from the Twitch API and using a large storage system (e.g. S3) and manage the content from an admin page. This way the clips could be curated and from other sources.
