- Project serves as a tool for inspecting usability metrics in Critical Manufacturing&apos;s Manufacturing Execution System (MES).
- Developed a customized dashboard to display custom insights for components inside MES, a Angular application used for managing indtustrial shop floors.
- Dashboard acts as a democratization of the improvement process of UX aspects of Critical Manufacturing as we provide scores for components and compose key metrics inside said components.
- Used Matomo to collect general metrics and track events to later access on client-side of the dashboard.
- Wrote a dissertation around this project with the title **Analytics and Usability Metrics for Single-Page Applications** avaliable [here](https://kikogoncalves.com/dissertation.pdf). Also interned at Critical Manufacturing as a part of product development team for this project.
