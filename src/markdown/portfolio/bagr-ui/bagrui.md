description: React.js, Typescript and Tailwind reusable components library.
team: Individual
---

- Developed a website to showcase reusable React TSX components combining purposes and methods from other components libraries.
- The idea of building this project came from seeing prominent components libraries like [Headless UI](headlessui.com/), [Tailwind UI](tailwindui.com/), [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and [Hyper UI](hyperui.dev/).
- Although competition existis, this is a way for me to store reusable components that I have used and perfected in my projects while also sharing them with everyone.
- This component library varies slightly from others because it is exclusive to use **React**, **Typescript** and **Tailwind** necessarily.
- Code sharing is done via Next.js API routes which are very helpful in accessing the filesystem and sharing the written code between the frontend and backend.
