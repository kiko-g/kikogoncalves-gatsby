There is a lot of cusytomizations that can be done to VS Code. In this post I will share with you interesting settings that aren't very popular but very useful :happy: (especially if you're a major customization geek like me).

### 1. Getting started

Once you've installed VS Code it can be overwhelming to understand all of it, but over time you'll come to realize how simple and extendable it is.

VS Code's settings are controlled by a file called `settings.json` that is somewhere in your filesystem, inside the folders of of your VSCode instalattion. Some of these settings are controllable via an interface on VSCode, but others... not so much.

In most systems there is a shortcut to access your settings which is `ctrl + ,` or perhaps `command + ,` if you're using a Macbook keyboard. Alternitively, you can navigate with the mouse to the top left to `File > Preferences > Settings`. In this page you can find a lot of UI configurations that will be appended to your `settings.json` file. Manually editing this file is possible and you can do it by pressing the icon seen below on the **top right of your settings page**.
